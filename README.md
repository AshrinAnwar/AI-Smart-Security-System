# AI-Based Smart Security System üîêü§ñ

An Arduino-based smart home security system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and responds to AI-style commands via Serial Monitor.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Motion detection using PIR sensor
- AI-style commands via Serial Monitor
- Visual and sound alerts (LED & Buzzer)
- Silent mode for non-intrusive alerts
- Fully simulated using Tinkercad

---

## üí° AI-Inspired Logic

The system accepts the following commands via Serial Monitor to simulate AI control:

| Command  | Function                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `alert`  | Manually trigger alarm                   |
| `silent` | Enable silent mode (no buzzer sound)     |
| `on`     | Re-enable system after turning it off    |
| `off`    | Disable system (no motion detection)     |
